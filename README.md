SliceWise: ML-Powered Resource Allocation for 5G Network Slicing

## Introduction

Cellular communications with the advent of 5G mobile networks, demand high-reliable communication, ultra-low latency, increased capacity, enhanced security, and high-speed user connectivity. To meet these user demands with rising population and increased network usage, mobile operators require a programmable solution capable of supporting multiple independent tenants on a single physical infrastructure. The advent of 5G networks facilitates end-to-end resource allocation through Network Slicing (NS), which allows for the division of the network into distinct virtual slices.

Network slicing in 5G stands as a pivotal feature for next-generation wireless networks, delivering substantial benefits to both mobile operators and businesses. This **slicewise-5g-resource-allocation** project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict the optimal network slice based on key network and device parameters. This project helps to manage network load balancing and addresses network slice failures.

## Dataset Characteristics and Target Classes

The dataset is structured to support the development of an ML model that can classify the optimal network slice based on device parameters such as,



The target output comprises three distinct classes:

Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB):

Focuses on high-bandwidth and high-speed data transmission.
Facilitates activities such as high-definition video streaming, online gaming, and immersive media experiences.
Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC):

Emphasizes extremely reliable and low-latency connections.
Supports critical applications like autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and remote surgery.
Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC):

Aims to support a massive number of connected devices.
Enables efficient communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart cities, and sensor networks.
